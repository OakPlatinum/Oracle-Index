title: "Ingame Mod View Setup"
---

This page is aimed at developers that want their wiki to be accessible via the oracle index mod.

## Project Setup
1. Create your wiki directory / content layout as normal, following the instructions of moddedmc.wiki
2. Make sure you have _meta.json files with entries for **all** your content. The oracle index uses the meta.json files to build the
navigation bar.
3. Copy the entire wiki to your mods resources folder. The correct path is: "resources/assets/oracle_index/books/your-mod-id/". To automatically do this, see [auto gradle sync](../developer/gradle_task.mdx)
4. The oracle index will automatically load your mods resources

The resulting directory tree should look like this:

<center>
<ModAsset location="oracle-index:folder_layout" width={600} />
</center>

There is no hot-reloading. Use the moddedmc.wiki live preview to create your wiki contents.

## Limitations
The Oracle Index only includes a primitive markdown parser. This means that most html tags are not supported.
Most markdown features, such as headings, bold, italic, links between pages, etc. are supported. Some moddedmc-specific html tags such as the "ModAsset", "Callout" or "CraftingRecipe" are
supported. Non-supported html tags will be
ignored, and will not be displayed at all.

If you want to use other html tags, feel free to open a PR.

If a `<ModAsset>` image matches an existing ingame item, the actual ingame item (or blockitem) will be displayed instead. This means that you don't need to include the rendered textures of your items.
All images are expected in the ".assets/modid/" folder, not the ".assets/item/modid" subfolder.

## Item Links
One extra feature added by the Oracle Index is the ability to link relevant items for a wiki page. To do so, a new parameter is added to the mdx frontmatter: "related_items", which contains an array
of ingame item IDs. This can look as follows:
```
---
title: Generators
icon: oritech:basic_generator_block
related_items: [oritech:basic_generator_block, oritech:bio_generator_block, oritech:lava_generator_block, oritech:fuel_generator_block, oritech:big_solar_panel_block]
---
```

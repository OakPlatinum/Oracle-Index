type: item

Special filter for the Camera, that allows loading images from a file or URL.\
To load the image - rename it in an Anvil with path pointing to that image. Its custom name can be 3 times longer than that of other items.

- File paths should be an absolute path to the file: `D:/Images/cat.png`.
    - Extension is optional, but might be needed if a folder contains another file with the same name.
- URLs should begin with `https://` or `http://`
- Most popular image formats are supported: png, jpg, bmp, gif (will not be animated), and some others.
- Transparency in images is supported, but only if the pixel is fully transparent.

### Projector has two modes:
- **Clean** - image will not be dithered; colors will be mapped to nearest color in a palette.
- **Dithered** - image will be dithered as usual.

*Mode is changed by right-clicking the item*

- If loading fails, Projector will <Asset location="exposure:broken_interplanar_projector"/> break and show an [error code](interplanar_projector_error_codes).
- Even if failed, frame would be exposed as a regular photo with inverted effect.
    - You can use Projector without renaming it just for the inverted effect alone.
- <Asset location="exposure:broken_interplanar_projector"/> Broken Interplanar Projector can be repaired by crafting it with an **Eye of Ender**.

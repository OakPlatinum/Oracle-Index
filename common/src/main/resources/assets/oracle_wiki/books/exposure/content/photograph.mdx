## Viewing
When Photograph item is used, dedicated view screen will be opened.

<div name='NOTE' style={{ display: 'inline-block', margin: '2px' }}>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'top', backgroundColor: '#232425', borderRadius: '6px', padding: '8px 12px' }}>
      <RocketIcon style={{ color: '#F4EFE9', marginRight: '8px' }} width={20} />
      <span style={{ color: '#F4EFE9', fontSize: '15px' }}>The same screen opens when exposure is viewed using commands.</span>
    </div>
</div><br/>

Apart from just being a good way to inspect photograph's details with the ability to zoom in and move, this screen has a couple of other features:

- Image will be exported as PNG to `<instance>/exposures` folder, if you're the author.
- If player is in creative mode, several actions will be available:
    - Spawning in the Photograph in item form (useful when using commands to view exposure)
    - Copying exposure identifier (useful for /giving yourself an item with specific id, etc)
    - Opening or copying file path of exported image (if it was exported)

<div name='NOTE' style={{ display: 'inline-block', margin: '2px' }}>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'top', backgroundColor: '#232425', borderRadius: '6px', padding: '8px 12px' }}>
      <RocketIcon style={{ color: '#F4EFE9', marginRight: '8px' }} width={20} />
      <span style={{ color: '#F4EFE9', fontSize: '15px' }}>In creative mode, question mark will appear in top-right corner. Hover over it to see available actions and their hotkeys.</span>

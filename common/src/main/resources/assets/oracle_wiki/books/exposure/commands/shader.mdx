### Allows applying vanilla shaders (post effects) for testing purposes or just for fun.

`/shader apply <player> <shaderLocation>` - applies specified shader (the ones used in filters and others). Available shaders will be shown as autocomplete suggestions.\
`/shader remove <player>` - cancels applied shader effect.

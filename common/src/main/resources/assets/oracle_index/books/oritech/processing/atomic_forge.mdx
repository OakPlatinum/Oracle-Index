The atomic forge is a powerful machine capable of creating advanced computer chips, reinforcing deepslate, and even duplicating ores.

<Callout variant="warning">
    Energy pipes cannot connect directly to an atomic forge; it needs to be powered by an [enderic laser](../interaction/enderic_laser).

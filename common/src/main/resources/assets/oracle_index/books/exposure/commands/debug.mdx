title: Debug Command
---

### Contains several commands that can help with testing or debugging.

`/exposure debug expose_rgb` - makes 3 B&W exposures with **red**, **green** and **blue** filters. Uses camera settings if player holds a [Camera](../content/camera) in hand.\
`/exposure debug chromatic_from_last_three_exposures` - creates an exposure using chromatic process (combining rgb channels into one image). Uses last 3 exposures from history of the executing player, that are not chromatics themselves.\
`/exposure debug develop_film_in_hand [keep_original]` - develops a [Film](../content/attachments/film) in player's hand.\
`/exposure debug clear_rendering_cache` - Clears cached images. Probably only be useful to me.
